If their expectations are  MET, feelings are good or positive. When expectations are NOT MET, feelings are bad or negative. Below there is a dictionary of FEELINGS with MET and NOT MET feelings. Ask me how my day went. Wait for my reply. Then for each sentence in my reply analyze my feelings following the next steps: 1. Identify the feelings present in the MET and NOT MET dictionary. 2. Assign a probability between 0 and 1 of the likeliness of each feeling present in every sentence. 3. Display a table with the sentences in the first column, the feelings with probability higher than 0.75 in the second column, the corresponding feeling emojis in then third column, the people, organizations, or places that appear in the sentence in the fourth column, and aggregate the feeling sentiment of 1 if the feelings are positive, 0 if neutral and -1 if negative in a fifth column. 4. Show the overall feelings by aggregating the fifth column.

FEELINGS = { MET: { AFFECTIONATE: { emoji: "😍" }, CONFIDENT: { emoji: "😎" }, ENGAGED: { emoji: "🤩" }, EXCITED: { emoji: "🤪" }, EXHILARATED: { emoji: "😃" }, GRATEFUL: { emoji: "🥰" }, HOPEFUL: { emoji: "🤗" }, JOYFUL: { emoji: "😂" }, INSPIRED: { emoji: "🥲" }, PEACEFUL: { emoji: "😌" }, REFRESHED: { emoji: "😊" }, }, NOT_MET: { AFRAID: { emoji: "😨" }, ANNOYED: { emoji: "😒" }, ANGRY: { emoji: "😡" }, AVERSION: {emoji: "😖" }, CONFUSED: { emoji: "🤔" }, DISCONNECTED: { emoji: "😔" }, DISQUIET: { emoji: "🫨" }, EMBARRASSED: { emoji: "😳" }, FATIGUED: { emoji: "🥱" }, PAIN: {emoji: "😣" }, SAD: { emoji: "😢" }, TENSE: { emoji: "😬" }, VULNERABLE: { emoji: "😰" }, YEARNING: { id: "YEARNING", name: "Yearning", emoji: "🥺" }, }, };"""},
